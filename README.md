# FRONTIER

Pay attention the `.gitignore` file. The majority of data files stored locally are ignored by github and not uploaded here. Also keep this in mind when pushing new local files, as files you are interested in pushing may be masked by this file and thus ignored.

The master table (`data/meta/Master_Sample_Sheet.csv`) was updated to use common paths for data files, now stored at `/projects/verhaak-lab/FRONTIER/`. This directory will also host the `master` branch of this github repository. Keep a local branch under your own directory that you can use for drafting updates, eg. I will host my personal branch `floris-dev` under `/projects/barthf/FRONTIER`. We should aim to merge changes into master every time a major change is implemented.
